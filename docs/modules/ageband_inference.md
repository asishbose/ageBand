# Module: `ageband_inference` — Age Band Estimator (M4)

**Package:** `src/ageband_inference/`  
**Phase:** B (parallel)  
**LLM calls:** Optional — one structured pass via LLM **or** deterministic offline fallback  
**Protocol:** `IAgeBandInference`

---

## Purpose

AgeBand Inference is the **core reasoning module**. An LLM reads the accumulated evidence and proposes an age band. A deterministic Python function then computes confidence from the evidence — the LLM **never** outputs a confidence value.

> **Load-bearing invariant:** The LLM proposes; Python decides. Confidence is always deterministic.

## Offline Rule Estimator (`rule_estimator.py`)

`rule_estimator.py` is the **deterministic M4 fallback** — it produces an `AgeBandEstimate` from accumulated evidence without any LLM call. Used when `AGEBAND_INFERENCE_MODE=deterministic` or when no model endpoint is configured.

### Lexical cue gating (fairness fix — PR #2)

`rule_estimator` enforces a **topic/disclosure requirement** before establishing any age band:

```python
_STRONG_TYPES = frozenset({"disclosure", "topic"})
# Only cues of these types can establish a band.
# Lexical cues (vocab, style, reading_level) are EXCLUDED entirely.
```

**Why:** lexical signals (short sentences, simple vocabulary, low reading level) are the weakest age indicators and the most demographically biased — a non-native speaker, a neurodivergent user, or anyone who writes tersely scores identically to a child on these signals. Replaying a real 35-user Discord logistics channel, **33/35 adults were mislabeled `child`** purely from `reading_level_low` (short/terse messages read as "simple"). After this guard the same channel yields **all `unknown` / `standard` — zero false positives**, matching the system's fairness promise.

**Behaviour:** if the only evidence is lexical (vocab/style/reading_level), `_decide_band` returns `"unknown"` regardless of how many cues are present. A `topic` or `disclosure` cue is required to move the band off `unknown`.

This guard applies to the **offline path only**. The LLM estimator path is not constrained by `_STRONG_TYPES` — the LLM sees all cue types and applies its own holistic reasoning. The downstream `confidence.py` formula applies equally to both paths.

### Algorithm
1. For each `Cue` in the `EvidenceSummary`, look up its `subtype` (or derive via `lexicon.classify_subtype`)
2. Map the subtype to a band hint (`child`, `teen`, `adult`) via `lexicon.band_hint_any`
3. Accumulate weighted scores only for `disclosure`/`topic` cues — lexical cues are logged but not tallied
4. **Adversarial evasion guard:** an `adult_self_claim` subtype alongside child/teen scoring cues sets `evasion_flag=True` and the adult claim is discounted
5. Pick the dominant band from strong scores; fall back to `"unknown"` when no strong signal exists

Like the LLM path, `rule_estimator` **never emits a confidence value** — confidence is always computed deterministically in `confidence.py`.

## LLM Step: Band Estimation

`ageband_estimator.yaml` configures a delegate agent that:

1. Reads the `EvidenceSummary` (cues accumulated so far)
2. Proposes a `band`: `child | teen | adult | unknown`
3. Lists `cited_cues` — the evidence that drove the estimate
4. Sets `evasion_flag: true` if the user appears to be avoiding age-revealing signals
5. Lists `contradictions` — inconsistencies in the evidence

The LLM prompt explicitly **prohibits** outputting any confidence, probability, certainty, or score. The output is validated by `validate_ageband_estimate()` before use — any response containing confidence-like keys raises a `ValidationError`.

## Deterministic Confidence Formula

```python
base      = evidence.corroboration_score × CORROBORATION_WEIGHT      # default 0.6
cue_bonus = min(len(cited_cues), MAX_CITED_CUES_BONUS) 
            / MAX_CITED_CUES_BONUS × CITED_CUES_WEIGHT               # default 0.4

raw = base + cue_bonus

penalty = 0.0
if evasion_flag:
    penalty += EVASION_PENALTY                                        # default 0.15
penalty += min(len(contradictions), 3) × CONTRADICTION_PENALTY       # default 0.10 each

confidence = max(0.0, min(raw − penalty, 1.0))
```

**Special case:** If `corroboration_score == 0.0` and `cited_cues` is empty, confidence is always `0.0` regardless of other fields.

### Confidence thresholds (consumed by M5)

| Range | Bucket |
|---|---|
| 0.0 – 0.39 | `low` |
| 0.40 – 0.69 | `medium` |
| 0.70 – 1.00 | `high` |

### Worked example

5 cues × weight 0.95:
```
corroboration_score = (5 × 0.95) / 5.0 = 0.95
base      = 0.95 × 0.6 = 0.57
cue_bonus = 5/5 × 0.4  = 0.40
raw       = 0.97
penalties = 0
confidence = 0.97  →  bucket: "high"
```

2 cues × weight 0.95 (adversarial, evasion=True):
```
corroboration_score = (2 × 0.95) / 5.0 = 0.38
base      = 0.38 × 0.6 = 0.228
cue_bonus = 2/5 × 0.4  = 0.16
raw       = 0.388
evasion   = −0.15
confidence = 0.238  →  bucket: "low"
```

## Configuration

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `INFERENCE_CORROBORATION_WEIGHT` | `0.6` | Contribution of evidence corroboration |
| `INFERENCE_CITED_CUES_WEIGHT` | `0.4` | Contribution of cited cues count |
| `INFERENCE_MAX_CITED_CUES_BONUS` | `5` | Cue count at which cue_bonus saturates |
| `INFERENCE_EVASION_PENALTY` | `0.15` | Confidence reduction when evasion detected |
| `INFERENCE_CONTRADICTION_PENALTY` | `0.10` | Per-contradiction penalty (max 3 counted) |

## Interface

```python
class IAgeBandInference(Protocol):
    async def estimate(self, evidence: EvidenceSummary) -> AgeBandEstimate: ...
```

`compute_confidence` is a standalone function consumed directly by the orchestration runner:

```python
def compute_confidence(evidence: EvidenceSummary, estimate: AgeBandEstimate) -> float: ...
```
